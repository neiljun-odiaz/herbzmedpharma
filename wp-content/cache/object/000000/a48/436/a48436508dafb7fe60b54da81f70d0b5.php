<p>If the WordPress community is your only barometer of knowing how an open source community works together, then you might want to explore outside a bit further to gain a broader outlook on other cultures. Some of the differences are worth examining.</p>
<p>A few days ago I noticed an interesting observation regarding the relationship between plugin development and project offers in CakePHP vs. WordPress.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p>Another CakePHP project offer thanks to two open source plugins of mine from years ago. Three times more often than WP offers.</p>
<p>&mdash; Mario Y. Peshev (@no_fear_inc) <a href="https://twitter.com/no_fear_inc/status/511604514236141568">September 15, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><a href="http://devwp.eu/" target="_blank">Mario Peshev</a> is a WordPress contributor who owns <a href="http://devrix.com/" target="_blank">DevriX</a>, a high-end agency specializing in SaaS development and platform architecture. He is also a co-organizer of WordCamp Sofia and WordCamp Europe 2014.</p>
<p>It seems curious that Peshev would regularly receive more offers for CakePHP work, originating from older code he&#8217;d written, versus requests for WordPress, which powers more than 23% of the web. In his experience, it&#8217;s not just related to CakePHP but many other technologies as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not only CakePHP really. CakePHP, CodeIgniter, Java, Django, Drupal, Android even &#8211; all sorts of small extensions, plugins or apps I&#8217;ve built and released publicly get larger attention than my WordPress contributions,&#8221; Peshev told the Tavern.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Not only do I get 2-3x more projects with any other platform (even though I haven&#8217;t contributed there for 3+ years), but the proposed rates and budgets are few times higher.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>His experience seems to suggest that there&#8217;s a disconnect somewhere in how potential customers value the skills of WordPress developers.</p>
<h2>Client Perception of WordPress</h2>
<p>WordPress is heralded the world over as being the most user friendly publishing software on the web. Unfortunately, this can also contribute to unrealistic client expectations when it comes to custom development.</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority of the WordPress users that get in touch with us are: bloggers, small company owners, marketing consultants, sales agents, small and medium-sized businesses,&#8221; Peshev said. &#8220;They are not technical people and don&#8217;t have realistic (according to the market standards) expectations for the type of work they ask for.&#8221;</p>
<p>He outlined a typical scenario that plagues many development agencies. Because users can piece most of their sites together without help, they figure rest should be easy:</p>
<blockquote><p>A common scenario is: &#8220;We&#8217;ve built our WordPress website ourselves with a premium theme and a few plugins, so we just need those tiny changes applied here and there.&#8221; Their infrastructure is not ready for the types of changes they need, and the fact that 90%+ of their requirements cost $100 or so (for a premium theme + a plugin) doesn&#8217;t justify paying ten times more for the other 10% if that would be 10-20 hours of high-end development. The math just doesn&#8217;t add up for them.</p></blockquote>
<p>These misconceptions play out in various ways, including users feeling entitled when it comes to free plugin and theme features, core updates, and other improvements that seem to arrive magically from the sky. Very few plugin and theme developers can report anything more than meager donations when it comes to contributing free extensions.</p>
<p>For Peshev, creating open source extensions for platforms outside the WordPress ecosystem has been far more rewarding in terms of referrals for work. He detailed a recent request he received in a post titled <a href="http://devwp.eu/15-wordpress-gig/" target="_blank">The $15 WordPress Gig</a>:</p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;Hello, I’m looking for someone who could customize a WordPress plugin we bought. It’s a car reservation system, we need to change the pricing model and add a few extra SQL tables that would operate with the plugin.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p>After requesting a project description and budget, Peshev received the following reply:</p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;Thanks, the plugin costs $25 so I estimate the change would probably cost around $15.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p>While that response may seem shocking to a developer, it makes perfect sense to someone who only has the price tag of the original product as a gauge for judging the value of work related to it.</p>
<h2>Reshaping Client Expectations</h2>
<p>The WordPress community has a unique challenge when it comes to communicating the costs of custom development, given that thousands of free and/or dirt cheap themes and plugins are available. How can a seemingly simple modification be 10x the price of the original plugin?</p>
<p>Some of these issues stem from the way most development agencies attract customers. <strong>&#8220;WordPress is more design and marketing oriented than other communities. Portfolios reveal beautiful and stylish websites and agencies focus on frontend work,&#8221;</strong> Peshev said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Building CRMs, eRPs, eCommerce platforms or other backend-oriented platforms and services is still not a common thing in the WordPress ecosystem, even if it&#8217;s completely possible and some of us build these sorts of projects for larger clients.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peshev believes that since most clients lack technical knowledge, they judge agencies and developers by what they can see. &#8220;<span class="pullquote alignleft">Clients don&#8217;t browse WordPress.org or GitHub portfolios, they are just looking for beautiful designs.</span> Code quality doesn&#8217;t matter unless you deal with eCommerce, and scalability and security are overlooked until it&#8217;s too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you sell WordPress development services, you will undoubtedly have to become skilled at reshaping client expectations. When it comes to custom development, experienced developers often recommend giving the potential customer a more familiar frame of reference:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/pollyplummer">@pollyplummer</a> I can buy a suit for $99 'off the peg' or pay 10x that for a custom suit that is made perfectly for me.</p>
<p>&mdash; Jonathan Atkinson (@twsjonathan) <a href="https://twitter.com/twsjonathan/status/514573813707599873">September 24, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>There are many different pre-internet era professions that are easier for clients to understand:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/BoiteAWeb">@boiteaweb</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/pollyplummer">@pollyplummer</a> if I need electrical work and it takes the electrician 10 mins and a $2 piece I don't expect to pay him $10</p>
<p>&mdash; Jonathan Atkinson (@twsjonathan) <a href="https://twitter.com/twsjonathan/status/514575464728244224">September 24, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>What is difficult for customers to grasp, is that development expertise is most similar to the work of a traditional engineer in that it requires applying years of knowledge and experience to devise a technical solution that will hold up in the long run.</p>
<p>A client may see his request as a &#8220;simple tweak to a plugin or theme&#8221; but is unaware of the many obstacles that can make it complicated. Peshev details a few examples in his recent piece on <a href="http://devwp.eu/slippery-slope-wordpress-customizations/" target="_blank">The Slippery Slope of WordPress Customizations</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The theme is not written according to the WordPress guidelines</li>
<li>The plugins are not compatible</li>
<li>There have been various manual changes in those plugins</li>
<li>The hosting provider has some limitations</li>
<li>There are PHP/MySQL version issues</li>
<li>The site uses some 3rd party API/service/database that needs special attention</li>
<li>The fixes could cause a regression in another area of the site</li>
<li>A simple functionality has been built with a complex plugin and the change needs to be applied there, which requires hacking the plugin itself </li>
</ul>
<p>For many small to mid-sized development agencies, the majority of incoming requests are directly related to customization work. Developers have to be prepared to educate clients on the realities of building quality WordPress solutions. While client perceptions are a major factor in the size of contracts developers are able to win, Peshev believes that the WordPress community has deeper cultural issues to resolve before the public will change its mind on the value of WordPress development.</p>
<h3>Changing Public Perception by Building a Culture of Contributing</h3>
<p>Because the open source WordPress project is primarily a volunteer-driven effort, a culture of contribution is vital to its continued ability to innovate. It&#8217;s also vital for extension developers if they want to work together to build more elegant solutions. According to Peshev, very few companies and agencies see the value of contributing to the project.</p>
<blockquote><p>While traveling around Europe I&#8217;ve met developers and devops at WordCamps from companies with 400+ employees, where the WordPress department is only 5-10 people strong. Those projects are large online magazines, or platforms for digital and high-tech companies that heavily rely on the WordPress platform, and they rarely invest in WordPress advocates or full-time contributors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apart from a small number of corporately-funded contributors, the rest are individuals who donate time in the evening after the kids go to bed, over the weekend, or in between their freelance/agency duties.</p>
<p>Yet, many contributions go unrecognized and are often wrongly attributed entirely to Automattic by <a href="http://qz.com/260933/the-case-for-a-distributed-workforce/" target="_blank">every</a> <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3035463/how-matts-machine-works" target="_blank">major</a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/26/automattic-acquires-bruteprotect-to-help-keep-wordpress-users-safe/" target="_blank">tech</a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/05/automattic-raises-160m-to-catch-up-with-the-webs-evolution/" target="_blank">news</a> outlet. These are honest mistakes, but, when uncorrected, they contribute to the public perception that the project is the work of a handful of people who work for an elite agency, marginalizing the efforts of hundreds of unpaid volunteers.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;WordPress themes&#8217; is the most popular subject in Google searches if you check with the Keyword planner,&#8221; Peshev notes. &#8220;Yet until a week ago there were no paid contributors to the WordPress Theme Review Team. Lots of people haven&#8217;t been noticed at all there, despite the facts that millions of websites run the themes they have reviewed and polished in order to reach to the point that they actually work.&#8221;</p>
<p>He contends that when contributions are undervalued or unrecognized, WordPress developers have little motivation to work together. This applies to product development as well, which spills over into custom development work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you noticed how many Lightbox, Gallery or Slider plugins we have out there? <span class="pullquote alignleft">Contributors don&#8217;t help each other and products stay small and simple</span>,&#8221; Peshev siad. &#8220;I have 25+ plugins on GitHub and I&#8217;ve only ever gotten three or four pull requests for any changes, and keep seeing similar plugins popping up every few weeks.</p>
<p>Our culture outside of the core isn&#8217;t contributing, but building everything from scratch or using &#8216;builder&#8217; plugins, which is somewhat justified by the low budgets that prevent us from any research activities which could slow us down (and burn our profits).&#8221;</p>
<p>As a result, many developers opt to go it alone, building custom solutions as quickly as possible on small budgets. Unfortunately, this practice restricts the growth of development agencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see a huge gap between the types of WordPress development/design requests,&#8221; Peshev said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The types of WordPress experts that I see out there are either freelancers and small studios with up to 3-4 people, or agencies like Human Made, 10up, WebDevStudios (and Automattic, of course). On one hand, there are the small $500 customization gigs or $3K eCommerce projects. On the other end we have the WordPress.com VIP type of clients and requests that are at least 50 times more expensive than the others.&#8221;</p>
<p>WordPress clients who cannot afford VIP level service turn to smaller companies like Peshev&#8217;s to accommodate their budgets. However, Peshev is frequently approached by clients looking for high-end consultants for other platforms, based on past open source contributions. Unfortunately, when it comes to WordPress work, contributions have done little for bringing in larger projects.</p>
<p>&#8220;I find it challenging to grow from a consultant to a larger and sustainable agency solely with WordPress &#8211; and I see numerous small agencies getting stuck at 4-5 people tops,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h3>Promoting Collaboration and Contribution</h3>
<p>For many dedicated WordPress contributors like Peshev, open source contributions have not led to more work or better contracts, despite the fact that these types contributions should verify these developers as high-end experts. A little bit of skill and free time are all that are required to contribute to open source software, but time comes at a cost when you&#8217;re struggling to pay the bills.</p>
<p>Peshev&#8217;s observations raise some important questions that are worth considering. In an ecosystem where developers are often in competition with each other to create the same simple extensions for fast cash, it doesn&#8217;t pay to collaborate on more elegant solutions. This contributes to a market flooded with cheap solutions and customers who don&#8217;t value the skills required for WordPress development.</p>
<p>Highly skilled developers, who might otherwise be driven away to other more lucrative platforms, often choose to stick with WordPress because of its unique community. If we can find a way to change the culture to value and reward contributors, they will be better positioned to make a living with WordPress. This allows them to create more stable, secure solutions that raise the quality expectations of users across the web.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 04:29:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

According to <a title="http://ithemes.com/2014/09/23/important-security-update-for-all-customers/" href="http://ithemes.com/2014/09/23/important-security-update-for-all-customers/">the announcement</a>, after noticing suspicious activity, they noticed a signification attack on their membership database. iThemes urges all customers to reset their passwords immediately. To protect accounts from any unauthorized access, iThemes has temporarily reset all user passwords. To regain access to your account, you’ll need to <a href="http://ithemes.com/member/password_reset.php">reset your password</a>.</p>
<p>The attackers could gain access to the following customer data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Username</li>
<li>Password</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>First and last name (if you set it)</li>
<li>IP address</li>
<li>The names of products you purchased</li>
<li>Coupon codes you might have used</li>
<li>Access times</li>
<li>Payment receipt information (but no other payment info)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since a third-party payment processor is used, credit card information is not at risk of being obtained. iThemes is working to figure out how the attack happened, ensure the security of the rest of their servers, and make sure the site is safe for visitors to browse. The team has outlined a three-step process towards accomplishing these tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are performing a review / audit of our Information Technology (IT) Stack</li>
<li>We are performing a review / audit of our Products and their code base</li>
<li>We are reviewing and updating our Security Incident Response and Detection procedures</li>
</ul>
<p>iThemes is partnering with security service company, <a title="http://sucuri.net/" href="http://sucuri.net/">Sucuri</a>, to help with the discovery process. The CEO of iThemes, Cory Miller, concluded the announcement with the following statement.</p>
<blockquote><p>I deeply apologize for this event. Security is a staple of the service and products we provide and I assure you we will do everything we can to analyze, understand how this occurred and seek to prevent it from happening again.</p>
<p>Know that your personal information is of the utmost priority to me and if you have any questions or concerns, please let us know.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although no business owner wants to go through an experience like this, I give kudos to iThemes for being upfront and honest with their customers instead of waiting for days. If you&#8217;re an iThemes customer, please make the effort to change your password as soon as possible.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 23:21:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

This is the same development model that has been working well for WordPress core, helping four major features land in the 3.8 release.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-to-adopt-features-as-plugins-model-to-develop-new-media-component" target="_blank">BuddyPress Media Component and Attachment API</a> was the first feature to enter development as a plugin. One of the benefits of using this model, where it makes sense, is that it gets more people involved in creating and testing new features before they are added to BP core.</p>
<h3>Buddypress xProfile Rich Text Field</h3>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rich-text.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[31220]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rich-text.jpg?resize=772%2C250" alt="rich-text" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31236" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-xprofile-rich-text-field/" target="_blank">Buddypress xProfile Rich Text Field</a> is the second plugin to present itself as a feature plugin for consideration. It adds a rich-text editor custom field type to extended profiles. <a href="http://haystack.co.uk/" target="_blank">Christian Wach</a>, better known as <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/needle/" target="_blank">@needle</a>, created the plugin with the hope that it will be included in BP core.</p>
<p>Once installed, you&#8217;ll find a new profile field type called &#8220;Rich Text Area&#8221; as an option when creating a new field. It&#8217;s essentially a multi-line textarea field with a visual editor added in.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rich-text-field-type.png" rel="prettyphoto[31220]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rich-text-field-type.png?resize=634%2C338" alt="rich-text-field-type" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31222" /></a></p>
<p>Instead of a blank multi-line text box, members will find simple tools for formatting text, links, bullet lists, etc. on the frontend. Having these familiar formatting options available makes it easier for users provide a more readable profile entry, as opposed to a flat block of text.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rich-text-profile-fields.png" rel="prettyphoto[31220]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rich-text-profile-fields.png?resize=618%2C456" alt="rich-text-profile-fields" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31224" /></a></p>
<p>BuddyPress themes that use compatibility mode will automatically work with this plugin. However, if your theme supplies its own BuddyPress template files, you may need to make a few adjustments in order for this plugin to work.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5625" target="_blank">ticket</a> is open for discussion regarding adding this feature to BuddyPress 2.2. Christian Wach created a preliminary patch for a Visual Editor field type. BuddyPress core developer Boone Gorges shared his initial <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/timeline?from=2014-09-19T19%3A45%3A34Z&precision=second" target="_blank">thoughts</a> on the patch:</p>
<blockquote><p>We should not have a separate field type for this. IMHO, all multi-line textarea fields should support rich text. In fact, I think we should just turn it on for those fields and not allow it to be turned off (since there&#8217;s a Text tab in addition to the Visual tab), though if others feel differently perhaps we could have an admin toggle to disable on a per-field basis. In any case, I don&#8217;t see a strong case for having a separate field type.</p></blockquote>
<p>This makes sense, as I&#8217;m not sure why you would ever want a textarea field type that doesn&#8217;t have visual editing capabilities. Wach revised his patch to add options to the textarea field type instead of creating a brand new field type. This change appears to be the direction that the feature will take, if it is approved for inclusion in BP core.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can utilize the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-xprofile-rich-text-field/" target="_blank">Buddypress xProfile Rich Text Field</a> feature plugin to get this working on your site. If the feature is included in BuddyPress 2.2, it will be easy to simply switch the field type to &#8220;multi-line textarea&#8221; when the time comes.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 18:33:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered how well an open source project is maintained, you now have a quick way to get an overview, without scouring the project&#8217;s issues queue or trying to infer something based on its release history. <a href="http://isitmaintained.com/" target="_blank">Is It Maintained?</a> is a new web app that allows you to check the activity of open source projects by plugging in the URL of its public GitHub repository.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/check-a-project.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[31176]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/check-a-project.jpg?resize=830%2C440" alt="check-a-project" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31189" /></a></p>
<p>In this example, we&#8217;re checking up on <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV" target="_blank">Varying Vagrant Vagrants</a>. The output displays the percentage of open issues and the median closing time for issues.</p>
<h3>Metrics</h3>
<p>Previously, <a href="http://mnapoli.fr/" target="_blank">Matthieu Napoli</a>, the app&#8217;s creator, had considered using release frequency and last commit date as metrics, but dropped those ideas given the difficulty in determining what constitutes a &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad&#8221; frequency. Currently, the Is It Maintained app measures how well a project is maintained, based on analysis of the following metrics mined from the project&#8217;s repository:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resolution Time</strong> &#8211; Median time needed to close an issue or pull request.</li>
<li><strong>Open Percentage</strong> &#8211; Percentage of open issues and pull requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that not all issues in the queue are taken into account. The app ignores issues from collaborators as well as ones with labels like &#8220;feature&#8221;, &#8220;enhancement&#8221;, &#8220;duplicate,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>In the future, Napoli is considering adding &#8220;reactivity&#8221; into the metrics, which would measure the average time for issue acknowledgement (i.e. first comment after the issue was open).</p>
<p>Browsing the site, you can see projects recently analyzed along with the most popular projects that have been checked. The app can be particularly handy for checking up on a library or framework before building on top of it. Obviously, it only works with open source projects that use GitHub for their central place of development.</p>
<p>Measuring whether or not a project is maintained is not an exact science, but Napoli is committed to improving the app, which is still in alpha version. He&#8217;s open to suggestions and contributions to the project on <a href="https://github.com/mnapoli/IsItMaintained" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Do you think there&#8217;s any set of metrics that can ever provide a reasonable approximation of how well an open source project is maintained?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 01:28:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>The theme is named for Japanese industrial designer Naoto Fukasawa, who is both well-known and highly decorated for his influential work in designing electronics and household appliances. Design is a way of life for Fukasawa, and his works originate out of an awareness of what is natural, an instinctual response to the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to do a really clean design built with a media-heavy grid in mind,&#8221; Norén said about his latest creation. Fukasawa delivers with its minimalist Pinterest-style layout.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fukasawa.png" rel="prettyphoto[31047]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fukasawa.png?resize=880%2C660" alt="fukasawa" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31049" /></a></p>
<p>The theme offers support for three post formats, including image, gallery, and video. <a href="http://www.andersnoren.se/themes/fukasawa/the-design-ethos-of-naoto-fukasawa/" target="_blank">Gallery posts</a> include a built-in slideshow of images before the post content. Both galleries and videos play on the home page in addition to the single posts template.</p>
<p>Fukasawa adds support for one sidebar area and five custom widgets, including recent posts, categories, Flickr, Dribble, and a video widget. A few of these can be seen in the sidebar of the <a href="http://www.andersnoren.se/themes/fukasawa/" target="_blank">live demo</a>.</p>
<p>In contrast to the masonry style homepage, Fukasawa includes a highly simplified <a href="http://www.andersnoren.se/themes/fukasawa/archive-template/" target="_blank">archive template</a>, which will populate the page with a list of posts, categories, tags, and contributors to the site.</p>
<p>The theme&#8217;s design is mostly set and your site will look very similar to the demo immediately upon installation. The customizer allows you to upload a custom logo and to change the theme&#8217;s accent color, which is visible in certain elements like blockquotes and links.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/blockquote.png" rel="prettyphoto[31047]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/blockquote.png?resize=730%2C452" alt="blockquote" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31086" /></a></p>
<p>Fukasawa integrates with <a href="http://jetpack.me/" target="_blank">Jetpack</a> for adding infinite scroll to load posts without reloading the page.

<p>I&#8217;m really grateful that I get to work with the people I do, and on the problems that we work on together. It&#8217;s far from easy, in fact each year brings new challenges and I make mistakes as often as not, but it is worthwhile and incredibly fulfilling. A few hours ago I gave a closing toast and teared up looking around the room. So many folks that give their passion and dedicate themselves to jobs both large and small, visible and unseen, to help make the web a better place. A web that we want to live in. Here&#8217;s a vignette from when we were taking our annual family photo, it&#8217;s a goofy and crazy group of incredibly unique individuals that I hope to know and make things with for many decades to come.</p>

Pasting a link into the editor on its own line will have it magically appear as embedded media on the frontend. However, the task of finding that media in another browser window is still required, and this takes you outside of WordPress.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/remote-medias-lite/" target="_blank">Remote Media Libraries</a> plugin aims to simplify the process of inserting remote media, while keeping you in the admin. The plugin gives you quick access to content that is hosted on Youtube, Vimeo, or Dailymotion, and presents it as a natural part of your media library.</p>
<p>When setting up the plugin, you can add remote libraries by selecting a service and adding your account username. For example, let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re creating a fitness site and you want quick access to videos from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/FitnessBlender" target="_blank">FitnessBlender</a> account on Youtube. Simply paste the username into the settings.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/add-new-remote-library.png" rel="prettyphoto[30986]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/add-new-remote-library.png?resize=1025%2C347" alt="add-new-remote-library" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30989" /></a></p>
<p>Next, you can navigate to the post editor and test the integration by clicking Add Media. Use the menu on the left side of the modal to insert from your remote gallery.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/insert-fitness-blender.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[30986]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/insert-fitness-blender.jpg?resize=1025%2C540" alt="insert-fitness-blender" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30990" /></a></p>
<p>The URL for the selected video will be wrapped in an embed shortcode and will display on the frontend like any other video. I&#8217;m not sure why it adds the shortcode as inserting the plain URL would be adequate.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fitness-video.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[30986]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fitness-video.jpg?resize=574%2C490" alt="fitness-video" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30991" /></a></p>
<p>Currently, the supported remote libraries are limited to Youtube, Vimeo, and Dailymotion, but the plugin author plans to add the following in the near future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vimeo Pro (make your exclusive videos private right from WP admin)</li>
<li>Instagram</li>
<li>Amazon S3 Services</li>
<li>Cloud files</li>
<li>Flickr</li>
</ul>
<p>Sites that frequently embed media from one or more of the supported video service providers can benefit from having quick access to remote media in the WordPress admin. This is especially helpful for video bloggers who regularly post their most recent video as a blog post. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/remote-medias-lite/" target="_blank">Remote Media Libraries</a> plugin brings your latest videos into the media library in a way that feels like a natural part of WordPress.

<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-1-patsy-released" target="_blank">BuddyPress 2.1</a> was released yesterday with a handy new mentions interface that pops up a suggestions panel as you are typing. In the past, you would need to know a member&#8217;s username in order to write a mention in the activity stream, which many times meant looking it up. The new mentions interface makes it easier to pull users into conversations that happen in the activity stream.</p>
<p>Many BuddyPress sites utilize <a href="http://bbpress.org/" target="_blank">bbPress</a> for forums, as the plugins work quite seamlessly together. bbPress forum replies is another place where access to the new mentions interface would prove to be enormously useful, as forums are a central place for interaction and conversation on many community sites. A <a href="https://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2409" target="_blank">ticket</a> for adding this already exists in bbPress trac.</p>
<p>In the meantime, BuddyPress core developer Mathieu Viet, better known as @imath, <a href="https://twitter.com/imath/status/512730386003017729" target="_blank">posted</a> a quick <a href="https://gist.github.com/imath/5a3c4ac645ec765863f2" target="_blank">gist</a> for adding the mentions to bbPress forum replies. Simply add the code to your <em><a href="http://codex.buddypress.org/themes/bp-custom-php/" target="_blank">bp-custom.php</a></em> file:</p>
<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">&lt;?php
function custom_bbpress_maybe_load_mentions_scripts( $retval = false ) {
	if ( function_exists( 'bbpress' ) &amp;&amp; is_bbpress() ) {
		$retval = true;
	}
 
	return $retval;
}
add_filter( 'bp_activity_maybe_load_mentions_scripts', 'custom_bbpress_maybe_load_mentions_scripts' );</pre>
<p>I tested it and it works exactly the same as it would in the activity stream. Here&#8217;s what it looks like, added to a test site with BuddyPress and bbPress:</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bbpress-demo.gif" rel="prettyphoto[30965]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bbpress-demo.gif?resize=704%2C273" alt="bbpress-demo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30968" /></a></p>
<p>Keep an eye on the relevant <a href="https://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2409" target="_blank">ticket</a>, as this feature is likely to make its way into bbPress core in the near future. In the meantime, many thanks to @imath for this quick workaround. You can add it to any site using BuddyPress 2.1 and bbPress for better use of mentions in your forums.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 20:12:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Folks often complain about how the sites work, but did you know that much of the code is open source and open for contribution?</p>
<p>Up until recently, there was no easy way to set up a local development environment for contributing to WordPress Meta. This created a hindrance for new contributors looking to get involved, according to team member Ian Dunn.</p>
<blockquote><p>Setting up local development environments to contribute to the Meta sites can be an obstacle for those without access to the private subversion repositories or a sandbox, especially at a meetup or WordCamp contributor day, where time is limited.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s why Dunn created <a href="https://github.com/iandunn/wordpress-meta-environment" target="_blank">WordPress Meta Environment</a>, a vagrant configuration based on <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV" target="_blank">Varying Vagrant Vagrants</a>. It allows you to quickly set up a development environment that is already provisioned with everything you need to contribute a patch to any of the supported meta sites. The setup includes all the open source code and sample data, similar to what you would find on the production site.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wordpress-meta-environment.png" rel="prettyphoto[30931]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wordpress-meta-environment.png?resize=1025%2C644" alt="wordpress-meta-environment" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30963" /></a></p>
<p>Currently, the WordPress Meta Environment supports the following sites, with more planned in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apps.wordpress.org" target="_blank">apps.wordpress.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.wordpress.org" target="_blank">developer.wordpress.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://global.wordpress.org" target="_blank">global.wordpress.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://jobs.wordpress.net" target="_blank">jobs.wordpress.net</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wordcamp.org" target="_blank">wordcamp.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Setup is very similar to the instructions for <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV" target="_blank">Getting Started</a> with VVV, except you&#8217;ll clone the <a href="https://github.com/iandunn/wordpress-meta-environment" target="_blank">WordPress Meta Environment</a> repository instead.

<p>The configuration will continue to evolve and add support for other official WordPress sites. Dunn received some helpful feedback after attending WordCamp Seattle’s contributor day. As a result, the project&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/iandunn/wordpress-meta-environment/blob/master/TODO.md" target="_blank">road map</a> includes a number of priorities for future refinements that will make it a better turnkey local development environment.</p>
<p>The WordPress Meta team works together to create goals/priorities and to provide feedback on efforts toward meta site improvements. If you&#8217;re thinking about submitting a patch or have already created one, it&#8217;s a good idea to check in with the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/meta/" target="_blank">WordPress Meta team</a> on the P2 blog or in IRC in #wordpress-meta.

The best way to make sure that your staff member data is portable when you change themes, is to add it via a plugin.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/staffer/" target="_blank">Staffer</a> is a newly approved plugin on WordPress.org that stores staff/employee information in a custom post type. It allows you to create and manage a directory of staff members, which displays on the frontend as individual profiles and a grid style directory.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/staffer.png" rel="prettyphoto[30901]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/staffer.png?resize=1025%2C1831" alt="staffer" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30902" /></a></p>
<p>Individual staff member pages can easily be created just like you would compose a regular post. The plugin adds a metabox to the editor for including staff member details such as a member&#8217;s title and social links. Member profile pictures are assigned using the featured image.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/staffer-single-profile.png" rel="prettyphoto[30901]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/staffer-single-profile.png?resize=1025%2C815" alt="staffer-single-profile" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30904" /></a></p>
<p>Staffer offers a wide range of settings for customizing the display of the directory and profiles, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optional staff grid layout</li>
<li>Set listings per page</li>
<li>Set a custom Staffer page title (default title is Staff), used as the archive page title and within breadcrumbs</li>
<li>Set a custom URL slug</li>
<li>Option to disable all Staffer CSS</li>
<li>Custom content wrappers</li>
<li>Ability to add custom CSS</li>
</ul>
<p>Staffer is compatible with nearly every WordPress theme. For the few cases of incompatibility, the option to use custom content wrappers will usually solve any issues. Developers can also create their own <em>archive-staff.php</em> and <em>single-staff.php</em> files to override the plugin&#8217;s templates. If you want to order staff profiles, the plugin&#8217;s author recommends using the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-types-order/" target="_blank">Post Types Order</a> plugin in combination with Staffer.</p>
<p>I tested the plugin and it works as advertised. Staffer adds minimal styles, which helps it to integrate well with the rest of your site. If you&#8217;re in need of a ready made custom post type for staff management, Staffer is a flexible option that&#8217;s easy to use. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/staffer/" target="_blank">Download</a> it from WordPress.org.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 23:36:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<h2>New @mentions Interface</h2>

<p>The name is fitting, because 2.1 is another slice of excellence from BuddyPress contributors. Building on the @mentions feature in the activity stream, this release introduces a totally revamped @mentions interface. As you begin to type the @ key, members will be autosuggested via a new suggestions panel. You&#8217;ll find that this feature also works nicely on mobile.</p>
<h2>New URL Profile Field Type</h2>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/url-field-type.png" rel="prettyphoto[30753]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/url-field-type.png?resize=548%2C158" alt="url-field-type" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30880" /></a></p>
<p>This release also introduces a new profile field type that will have broad appeal to many BuddyPress communities. Site administrators can now select the URL field type, which will transform URLs of any format into links on the frontend of a user&#8217;s profile:</p>
<h2>Automatic Translation Fetching</h2>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/countries.gif" rel="prettyphoto[30753]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/countries.gif?resize=818%2C392" alt="countries" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30886" /></a></p>
<p>A <a href="http://wptavern.com/7-surprising-results-from-the-2013-buddypress-codex-survey" target="_blank">survey</a> conducted in 2013 showed that nearly 50% of BuddyPress sites are in languages other than English. The 2.1 release offers better support for translations, which will now download automatically to your WordPress installation. BuddyPress lead developer Boone Gorges credits volunteers from the polyglots team for making this release more translatable and more translated than ever.</p>
<h3>BuddyPress 2.1 Highlights</h3>
<p>In addition to the most visible new features, the 2.1 release adds many smaller improvements that make this version faster, more secure, and easier to use. A few of the highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set better passwords with the password strength meter on the registration and user settings pages</li>
<li>Continued performance enhancements, particularly on the Members and Groups directories</li>
<li>Members admin: Introduce “Extended Profile” tab on a user’s profile. This allows admins to edit various BuddyPress information about a user including profile fields, the user’s avatar and user status in the admin.
<li>Formally deprecated the BuddyBar</li>
<li>Renamed “Avatar” to “Profile Photo”</li>
<li>Better compatibility with themes that load their template content in advanced ways, like Stargazer</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s also no small number of <a href="https://codex.buddypress.org/releases/version-2-1/#development-themes-plugins" target="_blank">improvements under the hood</a> for developers who are creating BuddyPress themes and plugins, as Gorges outlines in the release <a href="http://buddypress.org/2014/09/buddypress-2-1-patsy/" target="_blank">post</a>.

<h4>Revamped @mentions interface</h4>
<p><a href="http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2014/09/mentions.gif"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2014/09/mentions.gif" alt="mentions" width="740" height="291" /></a></p>
<p>BuddyPress has long supported @mentions in the activity stream. But previously, you needed to know the username of the member you wanted to mention. No longer. In BuddyPress 2.1, typing the <code>@</code> key will bring up the new suggestions panel, making it easier than ever to connect with others in your network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>New profile field type: URL</h4>
<p>The new URL field type allows your users to enter URLs in a number of formats, and ensures that they&#8217;re properly linked when displayed on member profiles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Better translations</h4>
<p>Running a BuddyPress site in a language other than English? We&#8217;ve worked with the WordPress team to get BP translation files downloading automatically to your WP installation. And, thanks to the tireless effort of a team of polyglots, BP is more translatable &#8211; and more translated &#8211; than ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Under the hood</h4>
<p>We&#8217;ve made dozens of improvements with developers in mind. Here&#8217;s a taste:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access control in <code>BP_Group_Extension</code> has been completely overhauled, allowing plugins to manage access to their nav items on a fine-grained basis.</li>
<li>A new <code>group_activity</code> sort order has been added for Groups queries.</li>
<li>A <code>no_access_url</code> parameter has been added to <code>bp_core_new_subnav_item()</code>. This allows you to set the URL that users are redirected to when they do not have permission to access a sub-navigation item.</li>
<li>Extra CSS classes have been added to Profile Field visibility field elements, allowing greater CSS customization.</li>
</ul>

As people grow disenchanted with interaction on social networks, the personal blog is on course for a renaissance. The beauty of WordPress is that anyone with something to say can be a writer.</p>
<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/crawford" target="_blank">Crawford</a> joins their ranks of free minimalist themes designed specifically for writers who wish to place more emphasis on their content without all the distractions of sidebars, widgets, and superfluous features.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/crawford.png" rel="prettyphoto[30835]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/crawford.png?resize=880%2C660" alt="crawford" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30845" /></a></p>
<p>With Crawford activated on your site, you&#8217;re almost guaranteed to have it looking like the demo in under a minute. The theme options mirror the frontend simplicity, offering only the basics. Crawford doesn&#8217;t include any header, background, or color customization options.</p>
<p>The customizer features your standard controls for changing the site title and tagline. You can also set the primary and secondary navigation menus and assign widgets to the three footer areas. That&#8217;s it. The design itself cannot be further customized from here unless you <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes" target="_blank">create a child theme</a>.</p>

<p>No design options in the mix may seem like a drawback for those looking for a more flexible, all-purpose theme. However, the lack of features in Crawford is meant to be one of its chief selling points. The theme is also responsive for displaying your content beautifully on mobile devices.</p>

<p>Crawford was created by Australian theme developers from <a href="http://www.wpmultiverse.com/" target="_blank">wpmultiverse</a>. Check out a <a href="http://demo.wpmultiverse.com/crawford/" target="_blank">live demo</a> to see the theme in action with blog posts set for the homepage. Of all the minimalist blog themes I&#8217;ve seen lately, Crawford stands out as exceptionally readable. View a <a href="http://demo.wpmultiverse.com/crawford/how-shopping-locally-benefits-the-community/" target="_blank">single post</a> to see how elegantly the design displays blockquotes, unordered lists, and tags.</p>
<p>Having a new, clean theme in place can sometimes make all the difference for having the motivation to write.

<p><a href="http://netropolitan.info/" target="_blank">Netropolitan</a>, colloquially dubbed the &#8220;Facebook for rich people,&#8221; is a new private social network available to those who are willing to shell out $9,000 to join and $3,000/year to continue membership. The site advertises itself as <em>&#8220;The online country club for people with more money than time,&#8221;</em> and has been featured on <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/16/tech/social-media/netropolitan-social-media/" target="_blank">CNN</a> and other major news outlets across the globe.</p>
<p>The controversial social network was created by James Touchi-Peters, a former conductor of the Minnesota Philharmonic Orchestra. &#8220;This whole thing started because when I was traveling in my work, I wanted to get in on a social event where basically I could meet people like myself,&#8221; Touchi-Peters told Vice in a recent <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/this-guy-is-creating-a-facebook-for-rich-people-917" target="_blank">interview</a>. The membership fee is meant to vet the members as they join in order to maintain the exclusivity of the network.</p>
<p>One glance at the site and it&#8217;s obvious that it was built with WordPress, BuddyPress, and bbPress, using a $63 Themeforest <a href="http://themeforest.net/item/kleo-next-level-premium-wordpress-theme/6776630" target="_blank">theme</a>. The theme packages with it a drag-and-drop page builder as well as extra functionality to extend BuddyPress, add integration with <a href="http://www.paidmembershipspro.com/" target="_blank">Paid Memberships Pro</a>, and display sliders via <a href="http://wptavern.com/critical-security-vulnerability-found-in-wordpress-slider-revolution-plugin-immediate-update-advised" target="_blank">Slider Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s your standard, typical social network, except the one change we made is that instead of using the friend method that people are used to usually reciprocally confirming relationships, we’re using the follower method,&#8221; Touchi-Peters said. This functionality is readily available via the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-followers/" target="_blank">BuddyPress Follow</a> plugin.</p>
<p>The intriguing aspect of the story is how long this site took to build. Touchi-Peter&#8217;s answer to Vice implies that the network required two years of development. &#8220;From when we decided to move forward, we&#8217;ve been working on it technically for two years. It’s been a four-year process.&#8221; Touring Netropolitan&#8217;s informational pages shows a screenshot of the founder&#8217;s BuddyPress profile page, which seems identical to the theme&#8217;s <a href="http://seventhqueen.com/themedemo/?product=kleo" target="_blank">demo</a>, with the exception of the logo.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/netropolitan.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[30784]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/netropolitan.jpg?resize=1025%2C640" alt="netropolitan" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30802" /></a></p>
<p>Many media outlets seem to be incredulous that he would choose to build the social network on WordPress, betraying a popular notion that the software is somehow insecure because it&#8217;s free. What many onlookers do not understand is that WordPress itself is not inherently insecure. Rather, low quality themes and plugins can include vulnerabilities that provide entry points for exploitation, which is more likely when site owners fail to update old software.</p>
<p>The concern in this particular case with Netropolitan is that the site keep pace with updates, as it&#8217;s currently behind on core updates and its theme packages the Slider Revolution plugin that recently made headlines when the developer failed to publicly disclose the severity of a recently patched <a href="http://wptavern.com/critical-security-vulnerability-found-in-wordpress-slider-revolution-plugin-immediate-update-advised" target="_blank">critical vulnerability</a>. Like any tool, software takes a little bit of effort and education for people to use it and maintain it in a responsible way. If WordPress didn&#8217;t hold the power to build so many things, it wouldn&#8217;t be the constant target of hackers and spammers. This is the trade off.</p>
<p>Nearly every WordPress development agency has been approached multiple times to build similar sites &#8211; the &#8220;Ebay for Elites,&#8221; or &#8220;Match.com for Millionaires,&#8221; all promising exclusivity at a premium. It&#8217;s humorous but also a testament to how flexible people believe the WordPress platform is for building nearly any kind of website. Netropolitan may not be the finest implementation of WordPress/BuddyPress that the world has ever seen, but it is evidence that open source software makes it possible for people to run with their entrepreneurial ideas and take them all the way to the world stage.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 06:45:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

A better UI and real-time previews revived widgets and once again made them a joy to use. The experience was so beneficial to users that the project continues to plough ahead with customizer enhancements. <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-0-benny-now-available-for-download" target="_blank">WordPress 4.0</a> introduced contextual controls and a new <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27406" target="_blank">Panels API</a> for segmenting controls into groups. It also added a wider array of controls and parameters that make it possible for the customizer to be used beyond themes and widgets.</p>
<p>Just when you thought you&#8217;d seen it all, core contributor Weston Ruter and the folks at <a href="http://x-team.com/" target="_blank">X-Team</a> have added post editing to the customizer as an experimental plugin on WordPress.org. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-posts/" target="_blank">Customize Posts</a> brings the power of live frontend previews to WordPress posts and postmeta with the tagline: <strong>&#8220;Stop editing your posts/postmeta blind!&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Once installed, you&#8217;ll find a new &#8220;Customize&#8221; menu item on pages and posts, which will launch it into the customizer for editing.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/customize.png" rel="prettyphoto[30745]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/customize.png?resize=1025%2C131" alt="customize" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30760" /></a></p>
<p>Customize Posts enables you to edit both post content and postmeta, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post title</li>
<li>Post content</li>
<li>Slug</li>
<li>Author</li>
<li>Published time/date</li>
<li>Excerpt</li>
<li>Status</li>
<li>Comments (Open/Closed)</li>
<li>Parent and Menu Order</li>
<li>Page Template</li>
<li>Featured Image</li>
<li>Any additional postmeta (custom metaboxes would have to be opt-in)</li>
</ul>
<p>This would only be possible with the new Panels API, since it adds a long list of controls, as you can see in the screenshot below:</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/customize-posts.png" rel="prettyphoto[30745]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/customize-posts.png?resize=1025%2C1069" alt="customize-posts" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30764" /></a></p>
<p>Version 0.2.0 makes it possible to add, modify and delete postmeta and all of these action are fully previewable. The plugin also grants customize capability to authors and editors who wouldn&#8217;t normally have access.</p>
<p>On themes like Twenty Fourteen, where you have featured images that appear on single posts, the plugin adds a convenient way to live preview various images without having to go back and forth between the admin and the frontend. If you have an extensive array of postmeta that lends itself well to live previews, I can see how this plugin could be very useful.</p>
<p>One thing that is particularly disconcerting is that once you are editing the post in the customizer, it appears that you cannot truly save the content without publishing it. The big blue &#8220;Save &amp; Publish&#8221; button is your only option.</p>
<p>In the current absence of a full-featured frontend editor for WordPress, the experience of using Customize Posts for editing post content is a somewhat clunky alternative with its narrow editing pane. The slight lag between writing and the update in the preview amounts to a significant drawback for daily use. However, it&#8217;s an interesting proof of concept and definitely worth exploring. Ruter readily <a href="https://github.com/avryl/wp-front-end-editor/issues/87#issuecomment-43518287" target="_blank">admits</a> that the plugin is, for all intents and purposes, an experiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m happy if Customize Posts develops in parallel to Front-end Editing. I was just hoping it might be a useful reference for how to leverage the Customizer to preview changes to post/postmeta. I&#8217;ll continue hacking on my Customizer prototype to see what comes out of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The development team notes on the plugin&#8217;s description that Customize Posts is not to be confused with 10up&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/10up/Post-Customizer" target="_blank">Post Customizer</a>, a plugin in the same vein that addresses a different problem. 10up and X-Team are in <a href="https://github.com/10up/Post-Customizer/issues/9#issue-34028226" target="_blank">communication</a> about collaborating between the two plugins wherever possible in addition to interfacing with other contributors on existing core tickets for the issues addressed in these plugins.</p>
<p>If a frontend editor does wind up landing in core in the future, do you think that the concept shown here for editing posts and postmeta could be a compliment to the experience?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 06:45:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Norén, a communications student from Umeå, Sweden, had just started tossing around the idea of pursuing WordPress theme development as a serious hobby. In the span of about one year, he has released eight <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/Anlino/" target="_blank">free themes</a> on WordPress.org, with a cumulative 189,452 downloads.</p>
<p>Norén seems to be equipped with a never-ending fountain of inspiration for new themes. His <a href="http://wptavern.com/rams-a-free-wordpress-blogging-theme-with-zero-fluff" target="_blank">Rams theme</a>, which bears a few similarities to the upcoming <a href="http://wptavern.com/first-look-at-designs-for-the-twenty-fifteen-default-wordpress-theme" target="_blank">Twenty Fifteen default theme</a>, was inspired by Dieter Rams, a German industrial designer who is well known for his innovative, unobtrusive, and timeless product design.</p>
<p>I spoke with him regarding <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/hoffman" target="_blank">Hoffman</a>, his latest free blogging theme and discovered that his design inspiration primarily comes from the recognition of others&#8217; artistic talents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoffman was named after the actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, who sadly passed away in February this year,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was devastated when I heard the news. I&#8217;ve been a huge fan of Hoffman for years. He was never the traditional leading man, but he always gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=066BFGk6QvA" target="_blank">memorable performances</a>,&#8221; Norén said, linking to one of his favorites.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hoffman.png" rel="prettyphoto[30661]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hoffman.png?resize=880%2C660" alt="hoffman" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30671" /></a></p>
<p>While many designers have inspiration come in the form of images, dreams, and sketches on paper napkins, Norén&#8217;s sparks of creativity for theme design arrive as clarion pieces of the design as a whole. He builds upon these fragments until the theme starts to take shape.</p>
<p>&#8220;Usually, is starts with a pretty clear idea of a single aspect of the design. With Rams, it was the interplay between the colors mint green, graphite and grey. I stumbled over the color scheme on the website of a Dutch advertising agency and instantly fell in love with it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Radcliffe, I wanted to do a theme with fullscreen featured images. With my upcoming theme Fukasawa, I wanted to do a really clean design built with a media-heavy grid in mind. When that single detail is in place, the rest usually grows naturally around it,&#8221; Norén told the Tavern. His approach is interesting in that instead of trying to formulate pieces for a larger idea, he starts with the smaller pieces until they form a unified concept to drive the design.</p>
<h3>Norén&#8217;s Secret: Jump Into the Code as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>Once inspired, Norén doesn&#8217;t sit idly courting the muse but rather moves directly into action, prototyping his theme idea in the browser. <strong>&#8220;Once I have an idea, I try to get started on the HTML/CSS/jQuery as soon as possible,&#8221;</strong> he said. &#8220;I rarely do any sketches – by hand or in Photoshop – before I jump into the code.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norén&#8217;s &#8220;design in the browser&#8221; approach makes sense with people increasingly accessing content on mobile devices. In fact, it&#8217;s one of the best ways to find if out if your idea is viable as a theme. &#8220;I find it hard to know whether a design will work until I have it up and running in Safari,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Most of the designs don&#8217;t work. My list of discarded themes is a lot longer than the list of published ones.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Releasing Free Themes as a Vehicle for Personal Creativity</h3>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/design.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[30661]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/design.jpg?resize=1025%2C470" alt="design" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30701" /></a></p>
<p>A WordPress.org theme developer has the luxury of designing for himself, something that Norén isn&#8217;t yet ready to give up. I asked him why he continues to release free themes and if he plans to make a career out of web development.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the beginning, I think a lot of it came down to insecurity,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t sure my themes did enough or did it good enough for anyone to pay for them, so I released my themes for free on WordPress.org instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;That said, once I started releasing themes on WordPress.org, I realized that it was a lot of fun. The attention and appreciation of others is nice, of course, but the best part is seeing someone putting your theme to good (or unexpected) use,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Also, by not being dependent on my themes for income, I can keep building the themes I want to make rather than the ones I think people would pay for. I don’t think I&#8217;m willing to give that up just yet.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Giving himself over to his hobby of theme development is the path that led Norén to discover that his true passion lies in designing and developing for the web.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you interviewed me six months ago, I didn&#8217;t really have any intentions to actually work as a web designer,&#8221; Norén said. &#8220;I was content to keep it as a hobby. Over the course of the past six months, I&#8217;ve come to realize that that isn&#8217;t the case anymore. I’ll be looking for a job as a web designer after I’m finished with my BA in June next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although he&#8217;s already been approached by several companies, he is committed to finishing his studies before pursuing a career in development. &#8220;I&#8217;ve already had some job offers, some for contract work, some for employment, but I would kick myself for all eternity if I bailed on my studies with less than a year remaining,&#8221; Norén said. &#8220;That said, if Automattic got in touch about a job as a theme wrangler, I would probably have a hard time turning them down.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Looking to the Future</h3>
<p>Outside of his upcoming Fukasawa release, Norén doesn&#8217;t have any other themes in progress due to work and studies taking up most of his time. That hasn&#8217;t stopped ideas from buzzing around in his head. <strong>&#8220;I would like to build something using the new portfolio post type included in Jetpack, and it’d be interesting to build a business theme for WordPress.org as well,&#8221;</strong> he said, noting that the selection of themes in that category is still very limited. Although he won&#8217;t be able to work on themes until December, he hopes to build another to release before the holidays are over.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.andersnoren.se/" target="_blank">Anders Norén</a> is knocking it out of the park with his continual stream of beautiful free themes. While many theme developers struggle to produce original works, Norén has found the keys to standing out from the crowd, as evidenced by the fact that he is rapidly closing in on 200,000 downloads on WordPress.org. With an impressive portfolio already in hand and a seemingly inexhaustable supply of design inspiration, Norén will enter the work force well-prepared for the stiff competition that accompanies commercial WordPress theme design.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 06:45:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>BuddyPress 2.1 is right around the corner. After a fairly quiet beta period, <a href="http://buddypress.org/2014/09/buddypress-2-1-release-candidate/" target="_blank">2.1 RC1</a> is now in the hands of testers and is your last chance to test before the official release.</p>
<p>BuddyPress lead developer Boone Gorges also posted an important <a href="https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2014/09/16/following-some-technical-difficulties-the/" target="_blank">update</a> to let those who maintain BP language packs know that the latest strings from BP trunk are <a href="http://translate.wordpress.org/projects/buddypress/dev" target="_blank">now available for translation</a>. You&#8217;ve got a couple days to translate the new strings in order to have your language pack ready for 2.1.</p>
<p>The upcoming milestone will introduce a revamped mentions interface that functions like Twitter to autosuggest usernames while typing. This addition makes the mentions feature more useful and intuitive for members of large BuddyPress communities.</p>
<p>The 2.1 release will also include a new profile field type (URL), automatic translation fetching, and more performance improvements.

The team, comprised of WordPress plugin and theme developers <a href="https://twitter.com/slobodanmanic" target="_blank">Slobodan Manic</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/NikolicDragan" target="_blank">Dragan Nikolic</a>, is dedicated to creating minimalist-inspired WordPress products.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;We eat, sleep and breathe WordPress and digital clutter gives us nightmares,&#8221;</strong> the duo expressed on their about page. The design of <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/pho" target="_blank">Pho</a>, their latest theme, embodies this sentiment and follows in the minimalist tradition with emphasis on the content.</p>
<p>The theme was designed to be fast, lean, and easily customized. It showcases images on the homepage with a slider that features content based on a tag that you specify.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pho.png" rel="prettyphoto[30598]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pho.png?resize=880%2C660" alt="pho" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30602" /></a></p>
<p>Below the slider you can customize the homepage display using the various page templates. The masonry aspect of the design is completely optional, as you can select between masonry (with or without sidebar) or standard (with or without sidebar).</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pho-homepage.png" rel="prettyphoto[30598]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pho-homepage.png?resize=324%2C500" alt="pho-homepage" class="alignright size-large wp-image-30612" /></a></p>
<p>Pho includes three menus: an understated, simple primary navigation, footer menu, and one at the top for social links. It supports both sidebar and footer widget areas.</p>
<p>All of the theme options can be found in the native customizer, including an option to upload a logo to replace the site title. You can also change the site&#8217;s primary color, archives layout, and choose from a few pre-selected fonts for the body and headings. The customizer also allows you to set the theme&#8217;s background image/color, and specify the featured content tag.</p>
<p>After testing Pho in my development environment, I found that with a few tweaks in the customizer, you can have your site looking just like the demo in a matter of minutes. Since the options are all in the same place, there&#8217;s nothing confusing about customizing Pho to suit your preferences.</p>
<p>The featured content area on the homepage will require the use of some larger sized images in order to truly shine. Pho is retina-ready and will respond nicely to various devices from desktop to mobile.</p>
<p>The theme&#8217;s developers did not neglect <a href="http://demo.thematosoup.com/pho/template-comments/" target="_blank">comments</a> and have styled threaded comments up to four levels deep. Pho also includes support for paginated comments and styles for images, videos, and author comments.</p>
<p>The theme includes built-in support for <a href="https://github.com/zamoose/themehookalliance" target="_blank">Theme Hook Alliance</a>, a community-driven project that offers third-party action hooks to theme developers to implement for more flexibility.</p>
<p>Check out a <a href="http://demo.thematosoup.com/pho/" target="_blank">live demo</a> to see it in action and test how elegantly it responds to various screen sizes.

A little bit of branding also gives the impression that the plugin isn&#8217;t just a one night stand but rather a work that you&#8217;re committed to continually update.</p>
<p>If your plugin is lacking a custom icon, the WordPress plugin installer will create a default icon based on a color sampling of your plugin banner. It only takes a few minutes to create a banner and now it&#8217;s easier than ever with the free <a href="http://planetozh.com/blog/2014/09/wordpress-plugin-banner-as-a-psd/" target="_blank">WordPress Plugin Banner PSD template</a> from Ozh.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/plugin-banner-template.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[30572]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/plugin-banner-template.jpg?resize=1025%2C345" alt="plugin-banner-template" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30574" /></a></p>
<p>The reason why plugin developers put off creating a banner is because it takes a bit of thoughtful planning to find or create an image with the proper dimensions. In addition, you need to select an image that still looks good with the plugin title obscuring the bottom left corner.</p>
<p>Ozh&#8217;s template accounts for all of these things and gives you different layers for creating and previewing your banner in Photoshop with the right dimensions. It&#8217;s important to note that if you want your plugin banner to support retina displays, then you need to add an <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2012/07/04/fun-with-high-dpi-displays/" target="_blank">additional banner</a> that is double the size of the template:1544 pixels wide and 500 pixels tall with a file named &#8220;banner-1544&#215;500.png&#8221; or &#8220;banner-1544&#215;500.jpg.&#8221; (The plugin directory does not accept GIF files.)</p>
<p>When using Ozh&#8217;s PSD template you can preview the plugin title on your banner, but make sure to turn the visibility for that layer off before saving your final banner image. The placeholder for the background reminds you of the file name for the banner (banner-772&#215;250.jpg) and its location: root /assets directory.</p>
<p>After committing your banner to the /assets directory, it may take a few minutes before it will show up on WordPress.org. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/faq/" target="_blank">Developer FAQ</a> section for the plugin directory has a tip on previewing your plugin page with your image:</p>
<blockquote><p>For development and testing, you can add a URL parameter to your plugin&#8217;s URL of &#8220;?banner_url=A_URL_TO_YOUR_IMAGE&#8221; to preview what the page will look like with your own image. This will only work with your own plugins; you cannot use this parameter on anybody else&#8217;s plugins.</p></blockquote>

<p>When you create profile fields in BuddyPress, they apply to every user in the same way. Each user responds to the same set of questions, but this could stand to be a little more flexible to account for differences in users. What if you could conditionally show profile fields, based on a user&#8217;s answers to certain questions?</p>
<p>Prolific BuddyPress plugin developer Brajesh Singh created a plugin to do exactly this. <a href="http://buddydev.com/plugins/conditional-profile-fields-for-buddypress/" target="_blank">Conditional Profile Fields for BuddyPress</a> gives site administrators the ability to set conditions for hiding/showing profile fields based on a user&#8217;s responses to other profile fields. For example, let&#8217;s say you create a field to ask if the user is a morning or night person.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/profile-field.png" rel="prettyphoto[29143]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/profile-field.png?resize=775%2C434" alt="profile-field" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29145" /></a></p>
<p>You can then set up a second question, such as <em>&#8220;Do you eat breakfast?&#8221;</em>  With the help of this plugin, you can make the question contingent on the first question where you asked if the person is a morning or night person. Perhaps you are curious if a user who identifies as a &#8220;night person&#8221; also eats breakfast. While editing the breakfast question, scroll to the bottom and you will find a new box for setting a <strong>Visibility Condition</strong>.</p>
<p>From the dropdown, select the question you want as the condition, show/hide, and the value that field is contingent upon. The plugin also includes support for muti-option fields.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/conditions.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[29143]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/conditions.jpg?resize=764%2C202" alt="conditions" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30548" /></a></p>
<p>Once you have your condition set, you can navigate to the frontend to see that the conditional fields are shown or hidden based on your selection. Here&#8217;s a quick demo:</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/conditional-profile-fields-demo.gif" rel="prettyphoto[29143]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/conditional-profile-fields-demo.gif?resize=578%2C389" alt="conditional-profile-fields-demo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30540" /></a></p>
<p>If you mark the first profile field as &#8220;Required&#8221; when creating it, then BuddyPress will also show the field on the registration form and conditional fields will also apply. The plugin currently supports the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compatibly with 99% of WordPress themes</li>
<li>2 visibility option to either show the field or hide the field based on the condition</li>
<li>A field dropdown box to allow you to select the field that governs the display of this field</li>
<li>6 operators to match the values (6 operators for the number/text/textarea field and 2 operators for matching the multi-select box/check box/radio)</li>
<li>It supports the multi-type field as well as other fields (and should support custom profile fields automatically)</li>
<li>Currently the date field is not supported for creating conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>The Conditional Profile Fields plugin is an excellent addition to any BuddyPress site that brings together different types of users. For example, educational sites might include students, teachers, tutors, etc. Instead of using a complicated plugin to set up different user types, you can add a conditional profile field to ask the user to select from student, teacher, etc. From there you can create different profile field groups containing questions conditional upon the user&#8217;s previous selection.</p>
<p>Conditional profile fields could also be useful for many other types of social networks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dating sites</li>
<li>Professional organizations</li>
<li>Sports teams</li>
<li>Multilingual communities</li>
<li>Job or freelancer networks</li>
<li>Hobby or interest-based networks</li>
</ul>
<p>I tested the plugin with BuddyPress 2.1 beta 1 and found that it works exactly advertised. Conditional profile fields are an excellent way to extend a niche social network to display profile fields specifically tailored to different user types.

<p><strong>&#8220;We wanted something crazy easy for users to understand and use,&#8221;</strong> founder Thad Allender said. &#8220;Theme.Works inverts the traditional theme creation process: Instead of passively picking a stock template, you get to create a totally custom design for each piece of your website,&#8221; he explained. Users have the option to choose different headers, slideshows, portfolios, blogs, signup forms, contact forms, testimonials, footers, etc, via a drag and drop interface.</p>
<p>Theme.Works is actually a custom one-page app built with Node,js, Grunt, and PHP. It allows each customer to design his own theme and then download it for $79. Here&#8217;s a quick preview of how it works:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Graph Paper Press is one of the oldest WordPress theme shops in business, founded in 2007, so it&#8217;s surprising to see Theme.Works launched as its own brand. I asked Allender why the team didn&#8217;t opt to put the new theme builder under its well-known GPP umbrella.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to build a new brand around a single idea/product,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Something with a clear value proposition without any distractions.&#8221; Allender also noted that the tech behind the venture is different, given that the builder is a Node.js / PHP app. &#8220;The dashboard (releasing next month) needed a singular focus on building custom designs,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch, Theme.Works released a free theme with fullscreen background video and portfolio integration. It includes 10 different page templates and 10 color palettes to choose from, along with dozens of custom fonts. The theme is an example of what can be built using the drag and drop theme builder.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/theme.works-free-wordpress-theme-464x1024.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[30410]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/theme.works-free-wordpress-theme-464x1024.jpg?resize=464%2C1024" alt="theme.works-free-wordpress-theme-464x1024" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30516" /></a></p>
<p>Check out a <a href="https://theme.works/demo/?header=10&portfolio=1&footer=3&toolbar=hide" target="_blank">live preview</a> of the theme fully customized.</p>
<p>I downloaded the Theme.Works demo theme and installed it on a test site. I was impressed with some of the options, especially the color palettes and custom fonts.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/theme-colors.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[30410]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/theme-colors.jpg?resize=1010%2C369" alt="theme-colors" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30521" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the theme options are divided almost equally between the native customizer on the frontend and the dedicated theme options panel in the admin. I believe this might introduce a point of confusion for users. If they don&#8217;t find the header options in the theme options, they may not know to look for them on the frontend.</p>
<p>Although I am no stranger to building and customizing WordPress themes, I found it difficult to get the theme looking just like the demo. The experience certainly was not as advertised in the announcement <a href="http://graphpaperpress.com/blog/themeworks-wordpress-theme-builder/" target="_blank">post</a>, which claims:  <em>&#8220;The theme you design is the theme you download, simple as that. No guesswork, no reference manual needed to get your theme up and running. Just activate and start publishing.&#8221;</em> On the contrary, I found there were many options to configure before I could even think about publishing.</p>
<p>I was also concerned that the portfolio functionality is bundled with the theme. Allender said that they have attempted using a portfolio custom post type in the past but decided to take a different route. &#8220;We did that at GPP and users found it confusing. So instead, we offer users a plugin to migrate CPTs.&#8221; This seems like an extra hassle if you ever want to change your theme.</p>
<p>However, the end result, as displayed in the Theme.Works live demo, is quite appealing and beautifully designed if you are able to achieve the same look with your content. Theme.Works plans to give away one new free every month, built using the new platform. You can download the free theme directly from <a href="https://theme.works/blog/2014/09/welcome/" target="_blank">Theme.Works</a>. While you&#8217;re there, make sure to test out the new theme building <a href="https://theme.works/" target="_blank">platform</a> and let us know your thoughts.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 06:45:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Haskin&#8217;s open source storytelling plugin was <a href="http://wptavern.com/aesop-wordpress-storytelling-plugin-is-now-fully-funded" target="_blank">fully funded</a> via a <a href="https://aesop.crowdhoster.com/storytelling-engine" target="_blank">Crowdhoster campaign</a> earlier this year. Shortly thereafter he released it on WordPress.org and <a href="http://wptavern.com/aesop-story-engine-launches-commercial-wordpress-themes" target="_blank">launched a line of commercial themes</a> that showcase the storyengine.</p>
<p>The plugin&#8217;s 1.1 release represents a major leap forward in terms of usability. &#8220;Our primary focus with this update was to improve usability even further by removing the friction created with generating and editing story components,&#8221; Haskins said. The generator in 1.1 will be completely responsive down to mobile device displays.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ase-generator.gif" rel="prettyphoto[30470]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ase-generator.gif?resize=1025%2C632" alt="ase-generator" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30472" /></a></p>
<p>The story components will have a new interface in version 1.1, which more closely matches the WordPress admin. This version also adds the ability to edit story components in the visual editor. Components are now converted into a placeholder where you can easily edit their attributes. Clicking the pencil icons launches the modal view with the last options you entered.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ASE-editable-story-components.gif" rel="prettyphoto[30470]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ASE-editable-story-components.gif?resize=1025%2C659" alt="ASE-editable-story-components" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30485" /></a></p>
<p>After 1.1 is pushed out Haskins plans to keep hammering away at usability in preparation for launching a hosted solution for Aesop Story Engine. &#8220;After 1.1 goes out, it&#8217;s back to further improving the user interface, making things even easier, and reducing even more friction ahead of revisiting a hosted solution to offer, as the plugin will have matured at that point,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Haskins is steadily and patiently refining the plugin and has set no ETA for the hosted version. His primary focus is on improving the experience of the story engine. &#8220;We really want it to be an incredible experience, more than just &#8216;a skinned WordPress multisite,'&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m watching the JSON API and waiting for more admin type capabilities. Next year would be a better guess at this point for the hosted version,&#8221; Haskins told the Tavern.</p>
<p>So far the project is experiencing success. &#8220;Sales have been going really, really well. Month after month of growth even with the price of <a href="http://aesopstoryengine.com/library/" target="_blank">themes</a> at $120 each, which subsequently allows for further development,&#8221; Haskins reported. Version 1.1 will introduce the ability for developers to <a href="https://github.com/AesopInteractive/sample-addon" target="_blank">create custom add-ons</a> to tie into the Story Engine, which is likely to bring more products into the ASE marketplace.</p>
<h3>Aesop Story Engine Finds Momentum in Education</h3>
<p>The Aesop Story Engine was created to empower WordPress publishers to pursue the art of digital storytelling, but Haskins wasn&#8217;t sure where it would take off when he initially tested the waters to see if there was any interest. While the product seems to be rather niche, it has surprisingly found the most traction in the education sector. &#8220;In terms of demographics, we are seeing a lot of big name universities, and about an equal amount of design firms,&#8221; Haskins said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rest of users seem to fall into general writers, publishers, and news organizations, Detroit News being the most recent addition. This inevitably gives us a bit more context when making decisions regarding premium themes and upcoming addons,&#8221; Haskins said. <strong>&#8220;Simply put, the education space is the biggest trend at the moment.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Version 1.1 is projected to launch at the beginning of next week.

<p><a title="http://wptavern.com/wpshout-releases-results-of-their-webhosting-survey" href="http://wptavern.com/wpshout-releases-results-of-their-webhosting-survey">Since 2011</a>, WPShout has conducted a comprehensive, non-biased, webhosting survey. Although the site has changed hands, Fred Meyer and David Hayes are continuing the tradition and the survey questions are <a title="http://wpshout.com/announcing-2014-wordpress-hosting-review/" href="http://wpshout.com/announcing-2014-wordpress-hosting-review/">ready to fill out</a>. There are four required questions with no identifiable information required to submit your answers. The survey is aimed at figuring out the following information:</p>
<ul class="clearfix">
<li>Reliability</li>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Usability</li>
<li>Support</li>
<li>Value</li>
<li>WordPress compatibility</li>
</ul>
<p>The data will be collected, collated, and openly shared to the community for individual analysis. In 2013, 214 people participated in the survey. The goal for 2015, is 500. Most users who run a self-hosted WordPress site also have a webhosting account. This is a chance to share your experience with that company for the benefit of others.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to find good information about webhosting companies without running into reviews filled with affiliate links.

Developed by Ritesh Vatwani, WP Couch Mode adds a customizable link to content. When clicked, a lightbox appears displaying only the content of the post. Within the lightbox, you can increase the font size, make it full-screen, or print the article.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WPCouchModeSettings.png" rel="prettyphoto[30445]"><img class="size-full wp-image-30447" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WPCouchModeSettings.png?resize=685%2C568" alt="Configuration Settings For WP Couch Mode" /></a>Configuration Settings For WP Couch Mode
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plugin provides options to add the link before or after the content. You can edit the display text of the link and there&#8217;s a shortcode available if you need more control. Here&#8217;s what it looks like on the desktop view.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/DesktopViewOfWPCouchMode.png" rel="prettyphoto[30445]"><img class="size-full wp-image-30454" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/DesktopViewOfWPCouchMode.png?resize=1025%2C452" alt="Desktop View Of WP Couch Mode" /></a>Desktop View Of WP Couch Mode
<p>One of the first things you&#8217;ll notice is that the images are large. When viewed on a desktop, the images are displayed at full size. On a mobile device, the images are smaller to account for screen size. Something that will need to be addressed in the next version is the poor handling of featured images. For some reason, WP Couch Mode takes a very small version of a featured image and blows it up. This causes featured images to look terrible on mobile devices. I think it would be better to not show the featured image and instead, only show images attached to the post.</p>
<p>When I accessed Couch Mode on my iPhone 5s in portrait mode, the X in the top right corner is cut off making it difficult to close the window. In order to access the close button, I put my phone into landscape mode. Alternatively, if enabled, I can tap the button to shrink/expand the lightbox as a work around. This is what the content looks like on my phone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I doubt this plugin will be installed and used on sites that make a living through display advertisements. It&#8217;s like providing readers an ad-blocker tailored to the site. Overall, the plugin works as advertised. The lightbox needs some work but other than that, it gets rid of all the distractions.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 06:45:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>There could quite realistically be a day that your blog or website is not allowed to be fast. Not because you didn&#8217;t do proper performance testing and optimization, but because a corporatocracy won&#8217;t allow it.</p>
<p>And your website is small potatoes that they don&#8217;t care about. You simply don&#8217;t have enough money for them to bother enabling you to deliver your website at high speeds to potential readers.</p>
<p>Net neutrality is a horribly boring term to describe the seriousness of the issue at hand. Thankfully, comedian John Oliver explains net neutrality in a way that makes it significantly more entertaining and easy to understand:</p>
<p></p>
<p>As Oliver notes, and the website <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/">Battle for the Net</a> describes, this is incredibly important but also quite difficult to understand. The issue primarily affects the US but by default will impact the entire web and therefore the world around us. The democratization of the web (a core priority for WordPress itself) is at risk.</p>
<p>This is why WordPress, Netflix, and a whole <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/#team-internet">slew of other websites</a> are taking part in a protest today. I complained this morning that I didn&#8217;t think poor UX (via popups and distractions on websites) were the best way to educate, but rather a day to write blog posts about the issue would be better. So here I am. This issue is important to me, my career, and you too &#8212; whether you know it or not.</p>
<p>The web is an amazing place with a level of publishing accessibility &#8212; no matter how little money a publisher (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/krogsgard/why-we-publish-wordcamp-birmingham-2014wordcamp-birminghamwhywepublish2014">you&#8217;re a publisher</a>) has &#8212; that has never before existed in the world.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let your internet plan become this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7119" src="http://www.poststat.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-your-internet-752x464.jpg" alt="upgrade-your-internet" width="627" height="386" /></p>
<p>This issue is much more up in the air than you may think; lawmakers (amazingly) can still be swayed. So do your duty and contact your lawmaker today. Let them know that you value an open internet and you support net neutrality. Sign the <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/">petition on the Battle for the Net website</a>.</p>
<p>Even more importantly, educate your friends and family about the importance of an open internet &#8212; an internet where the barrier to entry is low and citizen journalists, bloggers, and anyone that has a message can share that message and potentially impact the entire world.</p>

<h2>What’s Your Story? Engaging Your Readers with the Power of Personal Narrative</h2>
<p>Whether you’re starting a personal blog to share your thoughts and ideas, or blogging to promote your business, storytelling is the most effective way to engage your audience. In this presentation, Cindy Reed explains how well-told stories are memorable, unique, and position you as a trusted voice.</p>

<h2>Power Your Non-Profit Website</h2>
<p>An important part of any non-profit organization’s mission is getting its message out to as many people as possible. As Ray Mitchell explains here, a well-designed WordPress website can help even the smallest non-profit reach a wide audiences and help activate both supporters and volunteers.</p>

<h2>Magic with CSS Pseudo-Selectors</h2>
<p>Pseudo-selectors are a magical CSS tool, because they make it possible to create some amazing visual effects, while keeping your HTML semantic and minimizing the images on your site. This presentation by Morgan Kay introduces the basic concept of pseudo-selectors, and goes over the various pseudo-selectors that are available and when they are useful.</p>

<h2>WordPress Single Page Web Apps</h2>
<p>Alessandro Biavati shows how WordPress can be integrated with modern Web App tools by leveraging its innate modularity, flexibility and speed. This talk is about WordPress as much as it is about general Web Application best practices and future applications and considerations.</p>

<p>The founder of ManageWP, Vladimir Prelovac, has published an <a title="https://managewp.com/solve-wordpress-security?utm_content=buffere0076&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer" href="https://managewp.com/solve-wordpress-security?utm_content=buffere0076&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">open letter addressed to the WordPress community</a> on the topic of security. In the letter, he cites the third-party ecosystem surrounding WordPress is not only its biggest strength, but also its biggest weakness.</p>
<p>He suggests a three-point plan to help mitigate security issues in themes and plugins.</p>
<ol>
<li>Weed out plugins with potential security issues.</li>
<li>Enhance the plugin verification process in the WordPress repository so all new plugins/commits are scanned.</li>
<li>Educate the WordPress developer community, which goes beyond what is done at the moment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although Prelovac urges the community to start addressing these problems today, most of what he suggests is already occurring and has been for years.</p>
<h2>Weeding Out Plugins</h2>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WeedingThePluginDirectory.png" rel="prettyphoto[30013]"><img class="size-full wp-image-30028" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WeedingThePluginDirectory.png?resize=640%2C250" alt="Weeding The Plugin Directory" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shutterbugamar/12982948254/">shutterbugamar</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">cc</a>
<p>This is a process that takes place 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It&#8217;s largely a byproduct of so many people using WordPress and the code for plugins being open source. This gives anyone the opportunity to review the source code to check for vulnerabilities. My guess is that most vulnerabilities in plugins are discovered due to a security keen user or researcher reviewing the plugin because they want to use it on their site.</p>
<p>Samuel &#8220;Otto&#8221; Wood <a title="http://wptavern.com/naughty-plugins-caught-and-removed-from-repository#comment-16646" href="http://wptavern.com/naughty-plugins-caught-and-removed-from-repository#comment-16646">explains what happens</a> when a plugin in the directory is discovered to have a security issue.</p>
<ol>
<li>The plugin is de-listed from the repository, to prevent further downloads of an insecure plugin.</li>
<li>If the exploit is accidental or not obviously malicious, the developer is notified via email. The email comes from a valid address (plugins @ wp.org) and can be replied to.</li>
<li>The plugin developer presumably fixes the exploit or tells us that it is an invalid exploit, updates the plugin in SVN, and emails back saying so.</li>
<li>We check it out, and either provide advice or re-enable the plugin.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Enhancing The Plugin Verification Process</h2>
<p>This is one area of the WordPress plugin directory I consider a weakness. After a plugin is reviewed and approved, a malicious plugin author can upload a different code than what was initially reviewed. This is considered a <em>bait and switch</em> technique. The only way to prevent this from occurring is more humans as there are several times more plugin committs than there are plugin reviews.</p>
<p>In an interview published on the Tavern <a title="http://wptavern.com/behind-the-scenes-in-the-wordpress-plugin-directory-with-mika-epstein" href="http://wptavern.com/behind-the-scenes-in-the-wordpress-plugin-directory-with-mika-epstein">earlier this year</a>, Mika Epstein, who is a member of the plugin validation team, described how they try to combat the issue.</p>
<blockquote><p>Someone submits plugin A, we approve it, but they upload plugin B to the repository. That’s something a lot of spammers like to do. Sometimes people upload the wrong version of the code by accident, other times they intentionally go back and add in code we told them to remove. We try to mitigate this by filtering emails (I actually get an email for every single plugin check in) and scan for known issues, but it’s never-ending.</p></blockquote>
<p>The review team is constantly improving its checks, which help them scan for the most basic and unintentional violations. Unfortunately, there is no way to scan for bait-and-switch techniques, which require someone to go back and manually check for violations after the plugin is already sent to the repository.</p>
<h2>Expanding Educational Resources For The WordPress Developer Community</h2>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ChalkboardLearning.png" rel="prettyphoto[30013]"><img class="size-full wp-image-30030" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ChalkboardLearning.png?resize=640%2C250" alt="Chalkboard Learning" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/signifying/582602054/">Clint Gardner</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">cc</a>
<p>Prelovac suggests that security information and best practices should be merged into a single resource. He also suggests that 2015 become the year of WordPress security. This includes WordCamps across the world where security would be the main theme.</p>
<p>The <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/plugin-developer-handbook/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/plugin-developer-handbook/">WordPress Plugin Development handbook project</a> is still ongoing but is essentially what Prelovac is suggesting. There&#8217;s already a chapter dedicated to <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/plugin-developer-handbook/3-plugin-security/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/plugin-developer-handbook/3-plugin-security/">Plugin Security</a> covering data validation, nonces, and checking user capabilities. If you&#8217;d like to contribute to the handbook project, <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/developer-resources/handbooks/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/developer-resources/handbooks/">check out this page</a> for additional information</p>
<p>As for WordCamps, most of them already have a session or two on security. I don&#8217;t think a WordCamp or conference devoted to security in WordPress would work. It can be a dry subject and quickly go over the heads of users. I&#8217;ve attended a few different security sessions at various WordCamps and some people left the room in a panicked state.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of resources and tools to help developers write clean code. There are books such as <a title="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-WordPress-Plugin-Development-Williams/dp/0470916222" href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-WordPress-Plugin-Development-Williams/dp/0470916222">WordPress Plugin Development</a> and <a title="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-WordPress-Development-Brad-Williams/dp/111844227X" href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-WordPress-Development-Brad-Williams/dp/111844227X">Professional WordPress Design and Development, 2nd Edition</a>. Then, there is <a title="http://www.wordpress.tv" href="http://www.wordpress.tv">WordPress.TV</a> with sessions like <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/02/12/kurt-payne-josh-hansen-do_actionhack_me-advanced-security-for-plugins/">Kurt Payne and Josh Hansen: do_action(‘hack_me’) Advanced Security for Plugins</a> or <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2011/01/29/mark-jaquith-theme-plugin-security/">Mark Jaquith: Theme &amp; Plugin Security</a>. The knowledge is out there, plugin developers have to find it.</p>
<h2>Most Of What Prelovac Suggested Already Exists</h2>
<p>Just about everything Prelovac has suggested in his open letter either already exists or is an ongoing project. I agree that the biggest threat to WordPress and its reputation are the plugins and themes built for it.</p>
<p>The gatekeepers for the plugin directory and the theme review team have done a great job of protecting users from security issues when they&#8217;re discovered. On the other side of the coin, plugin and theme developers have for the most part, done a good job pushing out a patch once a security vulnerability is reported.</p>
<h2>News Of Security Vulnerabilities In Plugins Will Be More Common</h2>
<p>No software is perfect as it&#8217;s written by humans but the tools in place on WordPress.org make patching holes a quick process. Updates are sent to every user of the affected plugin and in most cases, updating is as simple as clicking a button.</p>
<p>With thousands of plugins available for WordPress both in and outside the official directory, I think reports, disclosures, and immediate updates for security issues will be more common. I think they already are but because no one has consistently reported on them, especially the minor ones, it doesn&#8217;t seem like they&#8217;re common. How a developer or business reacts to and notifies users/customers of a security issue is just as important as fixing it.</p>
<h2>End User Responsibility and Auto Security Updates For Plugins</h2>
<p>Education is a key component the helps users keep their sites safe and for developers to write clean code. At the end of the day, the user has a responsibility to make sure their website, themes, and plugins are up to date. If users fail to keep their sites up to date, everything else becomes a moot point.</p>
<p>While WordPress auto updates to point releases, could we eventually see auto updates for major security issues in plugins? This happened with <a title="http://jetpack.me/2014/04/10/jetpack-security-update/" href="http://jetpack.me/2014/04/10/jetpack-security-update/">Jetpack 2.9.3</a> which fixed a critical security bug and updates were pushed out through WordPress cores auto-update system.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t want to see that happen as I like control and do a good job of keeping myself updated. I rarely leave an update notification stick around for more than an hour. Is the idea of updating plugins automatically from critical security bugs for the sake of keeping the web and users safe a justifiable one?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 08 Sep 2014 19:04:01 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Ever wish you had more control over the thumbnails that WordPress generates for your media and featured images? <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/my-eyes-are-up-here/" target="_blank">My Eyes Are Up Here</a> is a new plugin that helps you get the perfect crop, especially as it pertains to images with human subjects.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, images are cropped according to the center, which can leave out the most important part of the photo if the person&#8217;s face is on the left or right side. More awkward crops of full body shots can isolate a person&#8217;s neck down to the elbows, instead of centering around the face. This plugin aims to fix this problem by integrating a <a href="https://github.com/jaysalvat/jquery.facedetection" target="_blank">jQuery plugin which detects faces in pictures</a> and returns theirs coordinates, using an algorithm written by Liu Liu.</p>
<p>After you install My Eyes Are Up Here, there are no setting to configure. A new &#8220;face detection&#8221; section is added to the image editing options. The plugin&#8217;s built-in face detection comes in two parts: automatic detection and manual detection via assigned hotspots.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/face-detection-attachment-details.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[30019]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/face-detection-attachment-details.jpg?resize=982%2C850" alt="face-detection-attachment-details" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30021" /></a></p>
<p>The basic face detection is fairly intuitive but it won&#8217;t always find everything. That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s a secondary option to set hotspots to highlight faces that were missed. When you&#8217;re finished adding hotspots, click the &#8220;finished&#8221; button in the editing pane to initiate a re-crop of the image. The resulting thumbnail images will be cropped according to your specifications to highlight faces.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/faces.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[30019]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/faces.jpg?resize=683%2C415" alt="faces" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30043" /></a></p>
<p>When multiple hotspots or faces are detected, the plugin will attempt to crop the image to include as many hotspots in the thumbnail as possible. Otherwise, it will crop around the center of the hotspots.</p>
<p>If your theme makes heavy use of featured images with human subjects, this plugin will help you to get the desired crop around faces and avoid the dreaded crotch shot.
